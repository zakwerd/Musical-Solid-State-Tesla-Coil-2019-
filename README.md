# Musical Solid State Tesla Coil (2019)

## Overview  
This page details the design and build process of my first attempt at a musical solid state Tesla Coil. Along with my successes, I hope to clearly display my mistakes and their causes. I am currently working on a new SSTC (and eventually QCW DRSSTC), which you can soon find updates for on my github.
